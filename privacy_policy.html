    <p>

    <h2>1. WHAT DATA DO WE PROCESS?</h2>
    
    <h3>Data We Do Not Directly Collect</h3>
    <p>
        We do not directly collect, store, or process any personal information from you that could be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, physical address, or phone number. Our Services are designed to be used without the need for you to provide this information to us.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Processed by Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>
        To provide core game functionality, our app utilizes third-party services from Google. While we do not receive your personal data from them, these services may process certain data to function.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Google Play Services (Play Games):</strong> If you choose to sign in to Google Play Games for features like leaderboards or achievements, Google will process your Google Play Games ID and game activity data (e.g., scores, achievements). This data is managed by Google.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> If you make in-app purchases, all payment information is handled securely by Google. We do not see, receive, or store your credit card number or other sensitive payment details. We only receive a confirmation of the purchase to unlock content in the game. This constitutes "Purchase history" which is processed by Google.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We encourage you to review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a> to understand how they handle your data.
    </p>
    
    <h2>2. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not directly collect your personal information, we do not use it for any purpose. Any data processed by third-party services is used solely to provide their respective features (e.g., displaying your score on a leaderboard, processing a purchase).
    </p>

    <h2>3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share any personal information because we do not collect it. Information related to your game activity (like leaderboard scores) is shared with Google Play Services to enable those features.
    </p>

    <h2>4. DATA SECURITY</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect our application. However, data processed by third-party services like Google is secured by them. No electronic transmission or storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>5. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h2>
    <p>
        Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you believe we may have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us so we can take appropriate steps.
    </p>

    <h2>6. UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by the "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently.
    </p>

    <h2>7. CONTACT US</h2>
